### What I learned

I learned that you cannot modify the colors of SVG images if used as a background image or with the <img> tag.
A good work-around was using the filter property in CSS to get the neccesary results, although still a bit overcomplicated.

### Continued development

A better understanding of SVG files and how to use/modify them properly.
Better understanding of how display:grid works and where to use it.
